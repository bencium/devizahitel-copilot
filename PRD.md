# IMPORTANT, FOCUS ON BANKS DID NOT DISCLOSE THE RISK OR NOT APPROPRETALY:
## context
2025: A Turning Point via the EU Court (CJEU): The status quo in Hungary shifted dramatically in 2025. A Hungarian case finally made its way to the CJEU, challenging whether Hungary’s approach truly aligned with EU law. In this case (originating from a 2007 FX leasing contract), the Hungarian Kúria referred questions to Luxembourg, essentially asking: can our courts refuse to void an FX contract even if the exchange-rate risk clause was unfair, given our national laws that “save” the contract? The CJEU’s answer (issued 30 April 2025) was a game-changer: it ruled that the contract was invalid in its entirety due to the lack of clear information about the exchange rate risk, and that all the monthly installments and costs paid by the consumer must be reimbursed ceelegalmatters.com . In other words, if a consumer was not properly informed of the FX risk, the term placing that risk on them is unfair – and since a foreign-currency loan cannot function at all without a risk-allocation term, the whole agreement is null and void ceelegalmatters.com . The borrower is then entitled to be put back in the position as if the contract never existed: they only owe the original principal (in forints), and every payment they made – all installments, interest, fees – must be paid back to them ceelegalmatters.com ceelegalmatters.com . The CJEU acknowledged that under EU law a contract can survive without an unfair term only if it’s still workable; here it wasn’t, so “not only the unfair term, but the entire ... agreement shall be annulled.” ceelegalmatters.com This ruling directly questioned the Hungarian courts’ earlier practice. It essentially said Hungary’s 2014 fix (forcing use of official exchange rate) cannot override EU consumer rights if the lack of initial transparency made the contract fundamentally unfair. Indeed, the Court noted that a national law like Hungary’s Act XL 2014, which replaces an unfair term to uphold the contract, cannot be applied if the consumer was not duly informed and does not explicitly consent to keeping the contract kuria-birosag.hu ceelegalmatters.com . Stability concerns or moral hazard fears do not excuse denying consumers the remedy of nullification when warranted ceelegalmatters.com safe-frankfurt.de . The impact of this CJEU decision in Hungary was immediate. On June 2, 2025, in one of the first cases applying the new precedent, the Pest Central District Court annulled a Swiss franc mortgage loan on the grounds that the bank had failed to properly inform the consumer about the exchange risk ceelegalmatters.com . The court declared the contract “invalid retroactively from the date of its conclusion”, meaning it was as if it never existed ceelegalmatters.com . The bank was only entitled to get back the original loan principal in forints, nothing more, and had to repay the borrower all installments, interest, and charges paid over the years ceelegalmatters.com ceelegalmatters.com . Effectively, the borrower was made whole and freed from the loan, while the bank bore the financial loss – a striking reversal of fortune. Hungarian media widely reported this outcome, and it was seen as a major victory for borrowers. Shortly thereafter, the Hungarian Kúria itself took action to align national jurisprudence with the CJEU. In July 2025, the Kúria’s Uniformity Panel issued Uniformity Decision 10/2025 (X.2.). This binding ruling stated that if a foreign-currency loan or leasing contract with a consumer is invalidated due to an unfair FX-risk clause, courts cannot then declare it valid under the 2014 Settlement Act’s provisions unless the consumer, after being duly informed, explicitly requests to uphold the contract kuria-birosag.hu . It also expressly overruled previous Curia case law that had prevented voiding contracts on the basis of the exchange-rate risk clause kuria-birosag.hu . In plainer terms, Hungary’s Supreme Court accepted that many past decisions were wrong in light of EU law – courts should no longer automatically “save” FX loan contracts, but should be ready to void them entirely and order restitution if the facts show the consumer wasn’t properly warned kuria-birosag.hu kuria-birosag.hu . This uniformity decision is critical, as it binds all Hungarian courts going forward. Opportunities and Challenges for Hungarian Borrowers: These developments give Hungarian FX borrowers a new opening to seek justice. Many observers expect a “reignition” of litigation on foreign currency loan contracts ceelegalmatters.com . Borrowers who either lost earlier cases or never sued may now try again, armed with CJEU-backed arguments. However, there are challenges. Hungarian banks will surely argue (and already started to, in media) that in most cases they did provide some warnings – for instance, loan documents often included general risk acknowledgment clauses. The key question in court will be whether the bank’s disclosure was sufficiently clear and specific to meet the “sufficient information for a prudent decision” standard eur-lex.europa.eu . The law firm that reported the Pest Court case noted: “only a few debtors will be able to prove” lack of proper information, “as in most cases, banks have informed their customers in detail about the risks” (according to the banks’ perspective) ceelegalmatters.com . On the other hand, consumer advocates point out that the quality of information given was often poor – generic statements buried in small print, without illustrating worst-case scenarios, likely insufficient under the CJEU’s criteria. Moreover, an interesting twist remains regarding another unfair term common in Hungarian FX loans: the two-rate currency spread (different exchange rates for disbursement vs repayment). As mentioned, the 2014 Hungarian law forced a fix for this term by using the central bank rate ceelegalmatters.com . Some experts argue this clause was fundamentally unfair and if not for the law, those contracts too might be void. They suggest that such contracts “might be declared invalid too, with the consequence that the debtor owes nothing beyond repayment of the capital” ceelegalmatters.com . However, current Hungarian law prohibits voiding a contract on that basis – it compels courts to simply replace the term and keep the loan in force ceelegalmatters.com . This could set up a future conflict between EU principles and Hungarian statute, potentially requiring legislative change to fully comply with EU law ceelegalmatters.com . The Kúria in its 10/2025 decision already signaled that Hungarian legislation may need adjustment to conform to the CJEU ceelegalmatters.com . Consumer Advocacy in Hungary: The recent turn of events has energized consumer activism. In mid-2025, a broad alliance of FX loan borrowers formed the “Banki Károsultak Fogyasztóvédelmi Szövetsége” (Bank Victims Consumer Protection Association). Backed by opposition figures, this group quickly gained tens of thousands of members – by July 2025, over 43,000 people had joined its online community alfahir.hu . The association aims to coordinate legal efforts and push for a systemic resolution by the state. Its leaders argue that the foreign-currency mortgage was a “faulty product” and that “those who unleashed it [the banks] must pay the compensation.” alfahir.hu They oppose any solution that would burden taxpayers; instead, they demand that “the banks pay!” for the damage caused alfahir.hu . One concrete proposal has been for the government to front the legal costs for borrowers’ lawsuits (so that lack of funds doesn’t hinder justice) and then recoup from banks found liable alfahir.hu . The movement is also pressing Parliament to enact a comprehensive relief law rather than forcing “hundreds of thousands of victims to litigate one by one for years.” alfahir.hu There is a sense that autumn 2025 may usher in a new phase of this saga, possibly a political solution, given enough public pressure alfahir.hu . In summary, Hungary’s experience with FX mortgages has evolved from initial denial and half-measures to a new recognition that consumer rights must be honored. While the government’s forced conversions in 2014 mitigated further currency losses for borrowers (Hungary notably avoided the catastrophic hit of the 2015 CHF spike that hit Poland and others), many borrowers still paid dearly or lost homes. Now, armed with CJEU precedents, Hungarian consumers have a stronger hand: if they can show that the risk was not fully explained, they have a good chance to invalidate the loan and claim refunds. The Hungarian Supreme Court and legislature are beginning to fall in line with EU law, suggesting that the era of automatically upholding these contracts is over.

TL;DR on your chances

CHF loan(s): strong–very strong, if the exchange-rate risk wasn’t explained in a clear, concrete way (e.g., worst-case HUF depreciation scenarios, how instalments could balloon). CJEU has doubled down that an unfair FX-risk term can nuke the whole contract and trigger full restitution. Recent Hungarian reference (C-630/23, 30 Apr 2025) is big, plus Dunai v. ERSTE (2019). 
Curia
EUR-Lex

EUR loan(s): moderate, not as slam-dunk as CHF, but still viable if (a) FX risk/clause wasn’t transparent, and/or (b) there were other unfair terms (buy/sell rate spread; unilateral interest/fee changes). Hungary’s “DH” laws already voided the spread trick and forced mid-rate use, but poor FX-risk disclosure can still carry the day. 
EUR-Lex
HUDOC

Why the law tilts your way (in plain English)

If the FX-risk clause is unfair and the contract can’t function without it, the whole deal can be invalid. That’s the CJEU line (e.g., C-630/23 on a Hungarian FX leasing case in 2025; Dunai v ERSTE 2019 on HU CHF loans; Dziubak 2019 on PL CHF loans). Courts shouldn’t “save” the bank’s contract unless leaving you worse off. 
Curia

EUR-Lex

If the contract falls, banks can’t bill you extra for “using the money.” CJEU C-520/21 (2023) curbs banks’ post-annulment remuneration claims; consumers may even seek certain ancillary losses under national rules. 
EUR-Lex
safe-frankfurt.de

Hungary’s 2014–2015 “DH” package already killed the buy/sell exchange-rate spread and mass-converted loans to HUF at MNB rates. Useful, but not a shield against separate unfairness in FX-risk disclosure. 
HUDOC
EUR-Lex

Claim strategy (step-by-step)

1) Triage your contracts (CHF vs EUR, each bank).
Mark, per contract:

Was the loan denominated or indexed to FX but disbursed/repaid in HUF?

FX-risk disclosure: any concrete warnings, stress-tests, examples of 20–30–40% HUF slide and instalment jumps? (This is the heart of transparency.)

Exchange-rate terms: did they use different buy/sell rates (spread)?

Unilateral change rights for interest/fees?
CJEU focuses on whether an average consumer could foresee cost increases and the economic consequences of FX moves. 
Courthouse News

2) Build an “evidence pack.”
Include: application forms, KHR/affordability docs, pre-contract info sheets, “risk information” leaflets, key facts statement, fee/interest change notices, full statements, amortization tables, marketing brochures, emails, and any branch “advice.” (Hungarian regulators and scholarship note these were frequent battleground items.)

3) Pick your forum & remedy ask.
You’ve got two practical routes—often used in sequence:

Financial Arbitration Board (PBT) – Faster/cheaper ADR first pass; good for settlement leverage. File a precise claim: unfair FX-risk clause → contract invalidity → restitution (or, subsidiarily, removal of unfair terms + repayment recalculation). PBT sees thousands of cases; they recognize FX patterns. 
MNB
+1

Civil court action – If no satisfactory settlement. Plead annulment + restitution citing C-630/23 (HU reference), Dunai (ERSTE), Dziubak (analogy), and C-520/21 on post-annulment money. Ask the court to restore you to the position absent the contract (return of sums paid minus net principal; interest set per national rules), and to reject any bank “use-of-capital” claims. 
Curia

EUR-Lex

4) Anticipate the bank’s defences, prepare counters.

“The DH laws saved the contract.” → CJEU says national ‘saving’ can’t block annulment where the FX-risk term is unfair and indispensable. C-630/23 narrows the space for saving tactics. 
Curia

“You were told FX is risky.” → Generic boilerplate ≠ plain, intelligible explanation of concrete consequences. Ask: where are the numbers/graphs/stress tests? (Kásler/Dunai line). 
Curia
EUR-Lex

“Limitation period!” → EU law requires time limits not make consumer rights impossible/overly difficult; CJEU has been protective (see Caixabank line; national courts must align). 
Recent ECL

“We deserve remuneration after annulment.” → Bank M., C-520/21 says no extra “use-of-money” fee beyond principal settlement, leaving space for consumer-friendly restitution. 
EUR-Lex

5) Remedial outcomes to push for (priority order).

Full invalidity + restitution (strongest on CHF): contract treated as never existing; you reclaim instalments/fees/charges; you return net principal; court settles interest offsets per HU law. No bank ‘use-of-capital’ uplift. 
EUR-Lex

Subsidiary: strike unfair terms (spread, unilateral changes), recalc with MNB mid-rate and fair conditions for the whole period (especially helpful on EUR loans if full annulment looks less likely). 
EUR-Lex

State liability (fallback, novel) if HU law can’t be read to fit CJEU remedies (flagged by commentators post-C-630/23). 
LawNow

Odds by scenario (rough, not legal advice)

CHF + weak disclosure (no concrete scenarios, sales spin like “stable CHF,” etc.): High likelihood of win/very favorable settlement. Dunai (ERSTE) helps directly on bank identity; C-630/23 tightens invalidity logic. 
EUR-Lex
Curia

CHF + solid, quantified disclosure (rare): Medium. You pivot to other unfair terms (spread, unilateral changes). 
EUR-Lex

EUR + weak disclosure: Medium. FX risk smaller than CHF historically, but the legal test is transparency, not size of past swings. Add spread/unilateral-change arguments. 
EUR-Lex

EUR + good disclosure: Lower, unless other abusive terms are clear.

What to do next (practical)

Catalogue each loan in a 1-pager: currency, dates, amounts, rate type, fees, annexes, copies of every “risk” document.

Red-pen the FX-risk language: highlight where they did—or did not—translate FX moves into monthly forint impact.

Pull the spread & unilateral-change clauses and tag them. (DH laws addressed these, but they still show unfairness history.) 
HUDOC

Draft a precise demand (bank & PBT): unfair FX-risk clause → ask for annulment + restitution, citing C-630/23, Dunai, C-520/21; in the alternative, removal of unfair terms + full recalculation at MNB mid-rate.

Expect settlement chatter once they see the case law and your document set is tight.

Bank-specific notes

Erste (HU): the Dunai judgment literally bears their name; courts know this terrain. Good leverage. 
EUR-Lex

Aegon (HU): less headline CJEU, but same legal standards apply; many Aegon-originated contracts used the same templates/clauses as the market. (Hungarian courts have annulled FX loans over disclosure/spread issues post-2025 momentum.)

• Then semantic confirmation: embedding similarity to clause exemplars with thresholds to reduce false positives.

Scoring
Score = 0.35IssueMatch + 0.25JurisdictionWeight + 0.2FactOverlap + 0.2ReliefAlignment.
• Thresholds: show ≥ 0.6 as strong, 0.45–0.6 as plausible, else hide.

Select relevant cases and export a Research Sheet PDF + JSON.

Manually form legal strategy and draft letters. Tool suggests pin-cites and argument bullets only.

12) Risks, assumptions, blind spots

Assumptions
• Key precedents are stable and finite. Multilingual embeddings are sufficient.

Risks
• False sense of certainty if ranking looks authoritative. Mitigation: show rationale and uncertainty bands.
• Mistranslation on HU/PL clauses. Mitigation: keep language-specific patterns, show source text.
• Scope creep into drafting. Mitigation: hard UI limits, no long-form outputs.

Blind spots
• Local first-instance quirks not captured in corpus.
• Evolving Hungarian practice post-2025 may shift relief patterns. Schedule quarterly corpus refresh.

13) Roadmap (only two increments)

V1 (2–3 weeks)
• Ingest, clause extraction, hybrid retrieval, ranking with rationale, Research Sheet export
• **Financial harm calculator** with MNB API integration for exchange rate comparisons
• **Loss documentation system** with Excel/PDF export functionality
• **Property foreclosure value input** field and damage summary reports
• **Guided action steps interface** displaying ACTION_STEPS_FOR_BANK_VICTIM.md content
• **Bilingual UI support** with English ↔ Hungarian toggle functionality
• **Interactive checklist system** with progress tracking and deadline alerts
• **Personalized roadmaps** based on loan type and bank-specific recommendations

V2 (4–6 weeks after V1 validation)
• Cross-encoder re-ranker, per-paragraph pin-cite extraction, simple timeline visual, batch processing for multi-client.

14) Seeds for the corpus (start list)

• **CJEU**: Andriciuc C-186/16; Kásler C-26/13; Dziubak C-260/18; AxFina C-705/21; Szcześniak C-520/21; C-287/22; C-327/22; recent HU reference on FX risk (2025); key Spanish "multidivisa" cases.
• **Hungary**: Kúria Uniformity Decision 10/2025; Pest decision annulling CHF mortgage (2025); 2014 Settlement Acts context; **Civil Code 241§ contract modification precedents**; **Banking Act 219/A-B§ intermediary liability cases**.
• **Poland**: SN resolutions on CHF loans; leading appellate clusters post-Dziubak.
• **Financial Intermediary**: Broker liability precedents under banking regulations; **consumer protection violations by financial advisors**; **inadequate advice and alternative analysis failures**.

15) Prompts and guardrails (for Claude Code later)

System guardrail
• “You are a legal research assistant. Do not provide legal advice. Only retrieve, compare facts, and cite verbatim holdings with paragraph numbers. If uncertain, say so.”

Task prompt template
• Inputs: client_facts JSON + top 10 precedent snippets.
• Output: 5–8 bullet arguments, each tied to case IDs and pin-cites. Include a “contra” bullet where precedent cuts against client.

16) Experimental legal strategy for Hungary (hand to counsel)

Objective
• Annul the 2006–2010 CHF/EUR mortgage as ab initio due to non-transparent FX-risk disclosure and essential unfair term. Seek restitution of all installments, interest, and fees; bank recovers principal only.

Elements

Evidence pack
• Full loan file, GTCs, annexes, any brochures. Proof of payment doubling. Bank communications. Affidavit on what was and wasn’t explained. Any risk acknowledgment text and its placement.

Legal grounds
• EU: Directive 93/13 transparency and unfairness; CJEU Andriciuc (duty to inform), Dziubak (no rewrite + annulment), AxFina (if essential term unfair, contract falls), C-520/21 (no use-of-capital compensation to bank).
• HU: Kúria 10/2025 alignment with CJEU; argue that 2014 “saving” rules cannot override where initial transparency failed and consumer doesn’t consent to uphold.

Relief sought
• Declaration of invalidity ab initio and restitution accounting.
• Alternative pleading only if court resists: strike bank-set exchange-rate clause and apply official rate refunds per 2014 acts, then re-argue invalidity if contract unworkable.

Venue and sequencing
• File in the borrower’s local competent court referencing 2025 CJEU guidance and Kúria 10/2025. Request preliminary reference only if the court attempts to “save” terms contrary to CJEU.

Anticipated defenses and counters
• Bank: “We disclosed risk.” Counter: generic boilerplate is insufficient under Andriciuc; require concrete scenario explanation evidence.
• Bank: “Contract stabilized by 2014 law.” Counter: Dziubak/AxFina bar rewriting when consumer was not properly informed and does not consent.
• Bank: “Economic stability.” Counter: CJEU treats stability as irrelevant for interpreting consumer protection remedies.
• Bank: “Consumer rented property, lost consumer status.” Counter: CJEU 2023 preserves consumer status if original purpose was private.

Settlement stance
• Entertain conversion-as-if-from-origination only if NPV beats expected litigation outcome. Require bank waiver of interest and fees and removal of any residual security.

Success criteria for the strategy
• Court admits lack-of-transparency evidence into record. Judge cites CJEU holdings in interim order. Bank withdraws “use of capital” counterclaim if raised. Favorable settlement or annulment within 12–18 months.

Minimal experiment
• Pick 3 Hungarian matters with different disclosure fact patterns. Run the assistant to produce packets. File one pre-action letter per matter with pin-cites. Measure bank response type within 30 days.

17) Next actions

Assemble the initial corpus list and 10 client docs. Create a 30-case gold set with your lawyer.

Build V1: ingest, rules for five clause types, hybrid retrieval, Research Sheet export.

Dry-run with one real matter. Time the end-to-end cycle. Adjust thresholds, not features.

After one win or a strong settlement offer, decide on V2.

This output is optimising for rapid delivery of a minimal, high-precision legal research assistant and a testable litigation playbook without scope creep.
