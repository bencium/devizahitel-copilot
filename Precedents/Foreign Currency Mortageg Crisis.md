Foreign Currency Mortgages in Hungary, Poland, and the EU: Consumer Protections and Legal Precedents
Introduction
In the mid-2000s, many European consumers – especially in Central and Eastern Europe – took out foreign currency-denominated mortgages (often in Swiss francs or euros) to benefit from lower interest rates. These loans were widely marketed as cheaper than local-currency loans, but banks often failed to warn borrowers about the serious currency fluctuation risks. When local currencies depreciated sharply during the 2008–2009 financial crisis, monthly payments skyrocketed – in some cases doubling or tripling within a couple of years – causing severe hardship

. Many families in Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Romania, and other countries faced over-indebtedness, foreclosures, or distress sales of their homes. Crucially, the lack of clear warnings about exchange-rate risk has been at the center of legal battles across Europe, as borrowers seek relief under consumer protection laws. This report provides a comprehensive overview of the issue – focusing on Hungarian precedents and consumer protections – while also examining similar cases in Poland and other EU countries. It reviews landmark court rulings (from national courts and the EU Court of Justice), legislative responses, regulatory findings, academic analyses, and consumer advocacy efforts. These precedents demonstrate how European law has evolved to address unfair foreign-currency loan terms and mis-selling, offering guidance to consumers preparing complaints or refund claims.
Background: The Foreign Currency Loan Crisis (2005–2010)
Foreign-currency mortgages became popular in several EU countries between roughly 2004 and 2010. In Hungary, for example, foreign currency-based home loans (especially Swiss franc loans) surged after 2006 because they carried significantly lower interest rates than forint loans
ceelegalmatters.com
. Similar booms occurred in Poland, Croatia, Romania, and others, as banks eagerly promoted CHF or euro mortgages to consumers. Borrowers were often led to focus on the initial interest savings, while exchange-rate risks were downplayed or not explained at all
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. Many consumers did not fully grasp that if their national currency weakened against the loan currency, their debt and installments would increase – sometimes drastically. When the global financial crisis hit and local currencies like the Hungarian forint and Polish zloty plunged against the Swiss franc, thousands of borrowers suddenly saw their monthly payments balloon beyond affordability
ceelegalmatters.com
. One Hungarian borrower’s experience was typical: after two years, her Swiss franc mortgage payments had nearly doubled, forcing her to sell her house. Indeed, in Hungary many families’ repayments “tripled, leading to mass foreclosures.”
ceelegalmatters.com
 A 2018 European Parliament study noted that by 2014 over 54% of all household loans in Hungary were in foreign currencies, and the rapid depreciation of the forint caused such widespread default risk that it became “not only a major financial consumer protection issue, but also a key economic and social policy issue.”
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
 Similar situations arose in Poland (where hundreds of thousands took out CHF loans), as well as in Croatia, Romania, and other countries
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. In each case, unhedged consumers faced a double risk – currency movements and interest rate changes – that few fully understood at the time.
Mis-Selling and Lack of Risk Warnings
A central problem in these foreign currency loan agreements was the inadequate disclosure of currency risk. In many cases, banks did not clearly inform applicants that their repayment amount could soar if exchange rates shifted. Investigations and reports in multiple countries later confirmed this failure. For instance, Poland’s Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) found that “banks at the stage of concluding agreements did not inform about currency risk in a comprehensive manner.”
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
 In Hungary as well, borrowers’ creditworthiness was often not properly assessed for worst-case scenarios, “and they were not warned of the exchange rate risk.”
europarl.europa.eu
 Banks frequently emphasized the initial low interest rate and lower monthly installment – the benefit – without a balancing warning of potential downsides. This practice took advantage of common behavioral biases, as one EU analysis noted: some lenders “highlight[ed] the initial advantages without warning of the risks when marketing mortgage loans.”
europarl.europa.eu
 From a consumer protection standpoint, such omissions are now widely seen as mis-selling. Borrowers were often not equipped to gauge the complex risk of a foreign currency loan – a product that “carries a high risk that [the] national currency devalues… and your debt will increase accordingly,” potentially even leading to personal bankruptcy
safe-frankfurt.de
safe-frankfurt.de
. In retrospect, many consumers were effectively unhedged and unaware of the worst-case scenario. By the early 2010s, the problem had grown so acute that the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) issued warnings about excessive foreign currency lending to unhedged borrowers, calling for coordinated action by regulators
europarl.europa.eu
. A number of national regulators belatedly stepped in with measures: for example, Poland’s Financial Supervision in 2013 instructed banks to first offer loans in local currency and obtain a signed statement from clients acknowledging they were warned of FX risks
europarl.europa.eu
. France’s prudential authority in 2012 recommended restricting foreign currency mortgages only to borrowers with income in that currency
europarl.europa.eu
. These efforts, however, came after the damage was done for many who borrowed in 2005–2008. Today, the consensus in the EU is that foreign-currency mortgages were often sold without proper risk disclosure, violating consumers’ right to transparent information. The EU Mortgage Credit Directive of 2014 (which took effect in 2016) explicitly addressed this, allowing foreign currency loans to consumers only if “either the consumer has a right to convert the loan into their home currency or other mechanisms are in place to limit exchange rate risk.”
safe-frankfurt.de
 In short, EU law now recognizes that currency risk must be mitigated or clearly explained. But for the loans already made in the 2000s, borrowers turned to the courts to seek justice, arguing that the one-sided allocation of currency risk to the consumer without proper warning was an unfair contractual term.
EU Consumer Protection Law and Key Court of Justice Rulings
European consumer protection laws have played a pivotal role in addressing these disputes. In particular, the EU Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive (93/13/EEC) has been the legal basis for most challenges to foreign-currency loan agreements. This directive prohibits unfair terms – defined as contract terms not individually negotiated that cause a significant imbalance in rights to the detriment of the consumer, contrary to good faith – and it requires that such terms “shall not be binding on the consumer.” If removing an unfair term changes the nature of the contract, the contract can even be invalidated entirely (unless the consumer prefers otherwise)

. Borrowers across Europe argued that clauses making them bear all currency fluctuation risk, or clauses allowing banks to set exchange rates arbitrarily, were unfair under this Directive, especially since the risk was not explained in plain and intelligible language. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has issued a series of landmark judgments clarifying how these principles apply to FX loans. Some of the major CJEU precedents include:
Andriciuc v. Banca Românească (C-186/16, 2017, Romania): In this case, Romanian borrowers argued that their CHF loan was unfair because the bank hadn’t explained the currency risk. The CJEU held that when a bank grants a foreign-currency loan, it “must provide the borrower with sufficient information to enable him to take a prudent and well-informed decision.”
eur-lex.europa.eu
 In practice, this means the bank should clearly explain how a serious depreciation of the local currency would affect installment amounts, so that an average consumer can grasp the risk
eur-lex.europa.eu
. If a bank failed to do so, the term placing currency risk on the consumer might not be considered “transparent” or intelligible, opening it to being deemed unfair
eur-lex.europa.eu
. Andriciuc affirmed that banks have a duty to warn borrowers of such risks under EU consumer law.
Kásler v. OTP Bank (C-26/13, 2014, Hungary): This early case (involving a Hungarian FX mortgage) dealt with a clause requiring use of different exchange rates for loan disbursement vs. repayment. The CJEU found that such a clause could be unfair if not transparent. Importantly, the Court said that if removing an unfair term would render the contract unworkable and nullifying the contract would hurt the consumer, a national court may replace the unfair term with a supplementary provision of national law
ceelegalmatters.com
. This was a nuanced exception aimed at protecting consumers from negative consequences of voiding a contract (like suddenly having to repay the entire loan at once). The Kásler ruling led the Hungarian Curia (Supreme Court) to conclude that banks’ use of a currency “exchange rate margin” in FX loan contracts was unfair, and Hungarian law (Act XL of 2014) then replaced those terms with a standard official rate
ceelegalmatters.com
. This ensured borrowers got a refund of excess charges while keeping the contracts alive, an approach we discuss further below.
Dziubak v. Raiffeisen (C-260/18, 2019, Poland): This high-profile Polish case concerned a CHF loan contract which contained an unfair term (the bank’s discretion to set the exchange rate for converting payments). The CJEU confirmed that if an essential contract term (like the exchange-rate clause) is declared unfair and null, and the contract cannot continue functioning without it, then the entire loan agreement must be invalidated, unless the consumer after being fully informed agrees to uphold the contract
ceelegalmatters.com
. Crucially, the Court reiterated that national courts cannot “rewrite” or modify an unfair term (for example by substituting a different exchange rate or currency) because that would undermine the deterrent purpose of the Unfair Terms Directive
ganado.com
. Following Dziubak, Polish courts began nullifying many CHF mortgage contracts, effectively freeing consumers from the debt (with mutual restitution of sums paid). The decision confirmed that EU law prioritizes the elimination of unfair terms even if the outcome is cancellation of the contract, as long as nullifying the contract doesn’t leave the consumer in a worse position

.
Aziz line of cases (various, 2013 onward): In earlier cases (like Aziz, Banco Primus, etc.), the CJEU had already emphasized that the Directive prevents courts from reducing or reformulating unfair terms – they must simply be struck out
ganado.com
. These principles set the stage for the FX loan decisions.
AxFina (C-705/21, 2023, Hungary): In April 2023, the CJEU ruled on a Hungarian case involving a 2008 FX vehicle loan where the borrower bore all exchange rate risk. The Hungarian court had found the FX-risk clause unfair, and asked how to determine consequences. The CJEU held that if a contract “includes a contractual term placing the exchange rate risk on the consumer” which is unfair, and if without that term the contract can’t survive, then the contract should be declared invalid in its entirety
ganado.com
ganado.com
. National courts should not try to “remedy” or save the contract by, say, changing the currency or imposing an exchange cap, except in truly exceptional circumstances where voiding the contract would be particularly detrimental to the consumer
ganado.com
ganado.com
. In general, voiding the contract requires the parties to be restored to their pre-contract positions – i.e. give back what was exchanged
ganado.com
. The AxFina judgment essentially reinforced that courts must not dilute consumer protections for the sake of preserving contracts: if the only way a loan makes sense is by an unfair term, the whole deal falls.
Szcześniak v. Bank M. (C-520/21, 2023, Poland): Decided in June 2023, this was a pivotal ruling on the consequences of nullifying CHF loans. Thousands of Polish borrowers had won cases invalidating their loans, but banks countered with claims that borrowers should pay for the “use of capital” (i.e. interest or fees as compensation for having the money). The CJEU firmly sided with consumers: it ruled that under EU law, when a mortgage contract is annulled for unfair terms, banks cannot demand any additional compensation beyond the return of the principal loan amount
reuters.com
reuters.com
. Conversely, it indicated consumers are not precluded from seeking compensation from the bank beyond just getting their past payments back (for instance, Polish law might allow consumers to claim the interest on sums they paid)
reuters.com
. In short, the Court said: the borrower can be made whole, but the bank cannot profit from its unlawful contract. This judgment – in line with the Advocate General’s opinion – also pointed out that arguments about protecting bank stability or the economy “are not relevant” when interpreting a consumer-protection directive
reuters.com
. The EU’s priority is protecting consumers from unfair practices, even if that means significant losses for banks.
Other recent CJEU clarifications (2023–2024): The Court continued to issue clarifications benefiting consumers. For example, in 2023 it held that a consumer does not lose their “consumer” status or the protections of the Unfair Terms Directive just because the loan-financed property was later rented out (C-327/22, 2023)
lexology.com
. In another case, it decided borrowers don’t need to file a separate formal statement of intent to have a contract declared invalid – courts can declare a contract void for unfairness without the consumer explicitly requesting annulment, simplifying procedures (C-287/22, 2023)
lexology.com
. And in early 2024, the CJEU reiterated that banks have no right to demand “valorization” or indexation of the loan capital once a contract is invalid – they must settle for just the nominal principal back
lexology.com
. All these rulings, along with a long-running trend of pro-consumer decisions, have “reinforced the legal landscape in favour of consumers, continuing a long-term trend.”
lexology.com
lexology.com
Together, these precedents establish that EU law robustly protects consumers in the foreign-currency loan context. Banks cannot enforce contract terms that were not fully transparent and clearly explained to the consumer
eur-lex.europa.eu
. If a critical term (like the FX risk allocation) is unfair, the default remedy is to strike it out; if the contract can’t stand without it, the whole contract can be voided, forcing a “reset” where each side returns what they received
ceelegalmatters.com
ceelegalmatters.com
. Courts are not allowed to soften the blow for banks by rewriting terms or inserting new provisions, except if voiding the deal would unexpectedly harm the consumer
ganado.com
. And if a contract is void, banks have no right to claim interest or other costs for the now-invalid loan – whereas consumers may even claim additional restitution under national law
reuters.com
safe-frankfurt.de
. This strong stance is meant to deter lenders from using unfair terms and to ensure consumers are not trapped in disadvantageous agreements.
Hungary: FX Mortgage Crisis and Legal Responses
Hungary was one of the countries hardest hit by the foreign-currency mortgage fiasco. Between 2004 and 2010, Hungarian banks aggressively sold CHF-denominated home loans, presenting them as a convenient low-interest alternative to high-forint-rate mortgages
ceelegalmatters.com
. By 2014, more than half of all household loans in Hungary were in foreign currencies
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. The risks became painfully apparent during the 2008–2009 crisis: as the forint’s value plummeted, monthly repayments shot up dramatically, in some cases by 2-3 times
ceelegalmatters.com
. Many families fell into default, and Hungary saw waves of foreclosures and evictions, sparking public outrage. Borrowers who had believed they were getting a stable loan suddenly found themselves in “an extremely difficult situation, due to exchange rate fluctuations”, as one legal analysis described it
ceelegalmatters.com
. Government Intervention: The Hungarian government intervened relatively early. In 2011, as the crisis deepened, it imposed an “exchange rate cap” scheme to temporarily limit how much installments could increase, and it also placed a moratorium on home evictions for defaulted FX borrowers
ceelegalmatters.com
. These were emergency measures to stem the social fallout. Then in late 2014, the government took a more sweeping step: it passed a law to convert all outstanding foreign-currency mortgages into Hungarian forints
ceelegalmatters.com
. This forced “forintosítás” was done at then-current exchange rates and was intended to fix borrowers’ obligations in HUF going forward, insulating them from further FX volatility. (Notably, this law was adopted without the customary prior consultation of the European Central Bank, drawing formal criticism from the ECB
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. The ECB warned that such retroactive steps could undermine legal certainty and contribute to moral hazard by signaling that borrowers might be bailed out of currency risk
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. Indeed, EU mortgage rules – Article 23(5) of the Mortgage Credit Directive – prohibit retroactive changes to foreign-currency loans, a provision Hungary arguably breached
europarl.europa.eu
.) Nonetheless, Hungary prioritized immediate consumer relief and financial stability over strict adherence to consultation, given the scale of the problem. Around the same time, responding to myriad lawsuits and complaints, the Hungarian Parliament also passed a set of “FX loan reconciliation” acts (Acts XXXVIII and XL of 2014, sometimes called the “Settlement Acts”). These laws declared certain common contract clauses unfair as a matter of law – notably the bid/ask exchange-rate spread that banks had used (buying low, selling high) when converting currency for loans
ceelegalmatters.com
. The law mandated banks to refund those exchange rate differentials and convert all repayments to use the National Bank’s official rate
ceelegalmatters.com
. In effect, Hungarian authorities retroactively standardized contracts to be more fair, instead of voiding them. The overarching goal of both courts and legislators in this period was to keep the FX loan contracts valid, but on more equitable terms
ceelegalmatters.com
. By converting loans to HUF and eliminating some unfair charges, they hoped to resolve the issue without collapsing the banking system or leaving borrowers with no financing. Borrower Lawsuits and the Kúria’s Stance: Despite these measures, many Hungarian debtors still felt wronged – especially those who had already lost their homes or paid colossal sums. Starting around 2011–2013, borrowers sued banks in droves
ceelegalmatters.com
. The typical claim was that the bank “failed to adequately inform [them] of the risks” of the FX loan, and that placing all exchange risk on the consumer was inherently unfair
ceelegalmatters.com
. Some plaintiffs argued that their entire loan contract should be deemed null and void for these reasons
ceelegalmatters.com
. Initially, Hungarian courts – guided by the Kúria (Supreme Court) – were reluctant to invalidate the loans outright. The Kúria issued binding uniformity decisions in 2013-2014 that, in essence, upheld the validity of FX loan contracts provided certain unfair elements (like the exchange rate spread or unilateral interest hike clauses) were stripped out. The Hungarian case law and legislation sought to ensure the contracts remained in force
ceelegalmatters.com
. Courts often concluded that as long as the loan agreement, once “fixed” by the new laws, was intelligible and balanced, there was no cause to annul it entirely. As a result, throughout the 2010s, debtors frequently lost lawsuits aiming to cancel their loans or claim full refunds
ceelegalmatters.com
. Hungarian judges would say: you’ve already been given relief through conversion and settlement, and the contract (now in HUF) must stand – a stance that protected banks from total loss on these loans. 2025: A Turning Point via the EU Court (CJEU): The status quo in Hungary shifted dramatically in 2025. A Hungarian case finally made its way to the CJEU, challenging whether Hungary’s approach truly aligned with EU law. In this case (originating from a 2007 FX leasing contract), the Hungarian Kúria referred questions to Luxembourg, essentially asking: can our courts refuse to void an FX contract even if the exchange-rate risk clause was unfair, given our national laws that “save” the contract? The CJEU’s answer (issued 30 April 2025) was a game-changer: it ruled that the contract was invalid in its entirety due to the lack of clear information about the exchange rate risk, and that all the monthly installments and costs paid by the consumer must be reimbursed
ceelegalmatters.com
. In other words, if a consumer was not properly informed of the FX risk, the term placing that risk on them is unfair – and since a foreign-currency loan cannot function at all without a risk-allocation term, the whole agreement is null and void
ceelegalmatters.com
. The borrower is then entitled to be put back in the position as if the contract never existed: they only owe the original principal (in forints), and every payment they made – all installments, interest, fees – must be paid back to them
ceelegalmatters.com
ceelegalmatters.com
. The CJEU acknowledged that under EU law a contract can survive without an unfair term only if it’s still workable; here it wasn’t, so “not only the unfair term, but the entire ... agreement shall be annulled.”
ceelegalmatters.com
 This ruling directly questioned the Hungarian courts’ earlier practice. It essentially said Hungary’s 2014 fix (forcing use of official exchange rate) cannot override EU consumer rights if the lack of initial transparency made the contract fundamentally unfair. Indeed, the Court noted that a national law like Hungary’s Act XL 2014, which replaces an unfair term to uphold the contract, cannot be applied if the consumer was not duly informed and does not explicitly consent to keeping the contract
kuria-birosag.hu
ceelegalmatters.com
. Stability concerns or moral hazard fears do not excuse denying consumers the remedy of nullification when warranted
ceelegalmatters.com
safe-frankfurt.de
. The impact of this CJEU decision in Hungary was immediate. On June 2, 2025, in one of the first cases applying the new precedent, the Pest Central District Court annulled a Swiss franc mortgage loan on the grounds that the bank had failed to properly inform the consumer about the exchange risk
ceelegalmatters.com
. The court declared the contract “invalid retroactively from the date of its conclusion”, meaning it was as if it never existed
ceelegalmatters.com
. The bank was only entitled to get back the original loan principal in forints, nothing more, and had to repay the borrower all installments, interest, and charges paid over the years
ceelegalmatters.com
ceelegalmatters.com
. Effectively, the borrower was made whole and freed from the loan, while the bank bore the financial loss – a striking reversal of fortune. Hungarian media widely reported this outcome, and it was seen as a major victory for borrowers. Shortly thereafter, the Hungarian Kúria itself took action to align national jurisprudence with the CJEU. In July 2025, the Kúria’s Uniformity Panel issued Uniformity Decision 10/2025 (X.2.). This binding ruling stated that if a foreign-currency loan or leasing contract with a consumer is invalidated due to an unfair FX-risk clause, courts cannot then declare it valid under the 2014 Settlement Act’s provisions unless the consumer, after being duly informed, explicitly requests to uphold the contract
kuria-birosag.hu
. It also expressly overruled previous Curia case law that had prevented voiding contracts on the basis of the exchange-rate risk clause
kuria-birosag.hu
. In plainer terms, Hungary’s Supreme Court accepted that many past decisions were wrong in light of EU law – courts should no longer automatically “save” FX loan contracts, but should be ready to void them entirely and order restitution if the facts show the consumer wasn’t properly warned
kuria-birosag.hu
kuria-birosag.hu
. This uniformity decision is critical, as it binds all Hungarian courts going forward. Opportunities and Challenges for Hungarian Borrowers: These developments give Hungarian FX borrowers a new opening to seek justice. Many observers expect a “reignition” of litigation on foreign currency loan contracts
ceelegalmatters.com
. Borrowers who either lost earlier cases or never sued may now try again, armed with CJEU-backed arguments. However, there are challenges. Hungarian banks will surely argue (and already started to, in media) that in most cases they did provide some warnings – for instance, loan documents often included general risk acknowledgment clauses. The key question in court will be whether the bank’s disclosure was sufficiently clear and specific to meet the “sufficient information for a prudent decision” standard
eur-lex.europa.eu
. The law firm that reported the Pest Court case noted: “only a few debtors will be able to prove” lack of proper information, “as in most cases, banks have informed their customers in detail about the risks” (according to the banks’ perspective)
ceelegalmatters.com
. On the other hand, consumer advocates point out that the quality of information given was often poor – generic statements buried in small print, without illustrating worst-case scenarios, likely insufficient under the CJEU’s criteria. Moreover, an interesting twist remains regarding another unfair term common in Hungarian FX loans: the two-rate currency spread (different exchange rates for disbursement vs repayment). As mentioned, the 2014 Hungarian law forced a fix for this term by using the central bank rate
ceelegalmatters.com
. Some experts argue this clause was fundamentally unfair and if not for the law, those contracts too might be void. They suggest that such contracts “might be declared invalid too, with the consequence that the debtor owes nothing beyond repayment of the capital”
ceelegalmatters.com
. However, current Hungarian law prohibits voiding a contract on that basis – it compels courts to simply replace the term and keep the loan in force
ceelegalmatters.com
. This could set up a future conflict between EU principles and Hungarian statute, potentially requiring legislative change to fully comply with EU law
ceelegalmatters.com
. The Kúria in its 10/2025 decision already signaled that Hungarian legislation may need adjustment to conform to the CJEU
ceelegalmatters.com
. Consumer Advocacy in Hungary: The recent turn of events has energized consumer activism. In mid-2025, a broad alliance of FX loan borrowers formed the “Banki Károsultak Fogyasztóvédelmi Szövetsége” (Bank Victims Consumer Protection Association). Backed by opposition figures, this group quickly gained tens of thousands of members – by July 2025, over 43,000 people had joined its online community
alfahir.hu
. The association aims to coordinate legal efforts and push for a systemic resolution by the state. Its leaders argue that the foreign-currency mortgage was a “faulty product” and that “those who unleashed it [the banks] must pay the compensation.”
alfahir.hu
 They oppose any solution that would burden taxpayers; instead, they demand that “the banks pay!” for the damage caused
alfahir.hu
. One concrete proposal has been for the government to front the legal costs for borrowers’ lawsuits (so that lack of funds doesn’t hinder justice) and then recoup from banks found liable
alfahir.hu
. The movement is also pressing Parliament to enact a comprehensive relief law rather than forcing “hundreds of thousands of victims to litigate one by one for years.”
alfahir.hu
 There is a sense that autumn 2025 may usher in a new phase of this saga, possibly a political solution, given enough public pressure
alfahir.hu
. In summary, Hungary’s experience with FX mortgages has evolved from initial denial and half-measures to a new recognition that consumer rights must be honored. While the government’s forced conversions in 2014 mitigated further currency losses for borrowers (Hungary notably avoided the catastrophic hit of the 2015 CHF spike that hit Poland and others), many borrowers still paid dearly or lost homes. Now, armed with CJEU precedents, Hungarian consumers have a stronger hand: if they can show that the risk was not fully explained, they have a good chance to invalidate the loan and claim refunds. The Hungarian Supreme Court and legislature are beginning to fall in line with EU law, suggesting that the era of automatically upholding these contracts is over.
Poland: Legal Battles over Swiss Franc Loans
Poland’s foreign currency loan story runs on a somewhat different track, as no one-step government solution ever occurred there. Instead, Poland became the epicenter of protracted legal battles between banks and borrowers, particularly over Swiss franc (CHF) mortgages. Background: Polish banks massively promoted CHF home loans in the mid-2000s, when Switzerland’s interest rates were very low. From 2006 to 2008, tens of thousands of Poles – possibly up to ~700,000 families – took out mortgages indexed or denominated in Swiss francs
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. At the time, Poland’s own interest rates were high and the złoty was relatively strong; many borrowers were told (or simply assumed) that joining the EU and perhaps eventually the eurozone would keep their currency stable
safe-frankfurt.de
. Unfortunately, the złoty sharply depreciated during the financial crisis and again in the 2010s, while the Swiss franc surged (exacerbated by the Swiss central bank’s actions in 2015). Polish borrowers were left owing far higher amounts in złoty than they borrowed, and their monthly payments climbed dramatically, just as in Hungary. Unlike Hungary, however, the Polish government did not force a conversion of loans. Various administrations considered legislation (and some small conversion support programs appeared, largely ineffective), but ultimately authorities favored a case-by-case judicial approach. The Polish Financial Supervisory Authority (KNF) and central bank warned of the potential destabilization of banks if forced conversion was imposed at non-market rates. Thus, Polish CHF borrowers turned en masse to the courts for relief. Consumer Protection Authorities: The Polish competition and consumer office (UOKiK) investigated and found many instances of unfair terms in these loan contracts – for example, clauses where banks could set exchange rates arbitrarily (creating wide spreads), or failed to inform customers properly
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. UOKiK and consumer ombudsmen supported borrowers in litigation, citing the same EU Directive 93/13 on unfair terms. Notably, Polish courts asked the CJEU for guidance early (leading to cases like Dziubak in 2019). By around 2017–2018, lower courts were increasingly ruling in favor of consumers: either nullifying the entire loan agreement or removing the unfair FX indexation and treating the loan as a złoty loan at the original interest rate. Either outcome was very costly for banks. Key Court Decisions in Poland: The watershed moment was the CJEU’s Dziubak judgment (2019), which empowered Polish judges to declare CHF loan agreements void if the unfair terms (e.g., the exchange rate clause) were essential
ceelegalmatters.com
. Polish courts interpreted this to mean that if a contract’s main currency mechanism was unfair, they should nullify the contract rather than rewrite it. Following Dziubak, case after case was won by borrowers. The Polish Supreme Court (SN) was expected to issue a comprehensive resolution to unify the jurisprudence (there was some divergence on technical details like methods of settlement after nullification), but this was delayed multiple times due to unrelated controversies (issues about the appointment of judges, etc.). Eventually, in late 2022, the Supreme Court Civil Chamber did adopt a resolution (III CZP 25/22) that “unified previous case law, reinforcing consumer-friendly interpretations and strengthening legal certainty for borrowers.”
lexology.com
 In essence, the Supreme Court agreed that most of these CHF contracts were voidable and outlined how banks and borrowers should settle accounts (two separate restitution claims that usually offset each other). By 2023–2024, Polish jurisprudence was strongly pro-consumer, thanks in part to further CJEU rulings (mentioned earlier, e.g., C-520/21 in 2023 on no bank compensation, and other procedural clarifications in 2023). One law firm’s review noted that “the year 2024 was a positive time for Polish consumers engaged in legal battles,” with a series of CJEU and Supreme Court decisions continuing the long-term trend favoring borrowers
lexology.com
lexology.com
. Courts consistently found that banks’ failure to adequately explain currency risk or the inclusion of abusive exchange-rate clauses violated consumers’ rights. By late 2024, Polish banks reported an avalanche of lawsuits – over 120,000 active cases in court, winning rates of around 97% in favor of consumers
reuters.com
lexology.com
. The backlog grew so large (average case taking ~1.5 years) that it highlighted systemic issues in the judiciary
lexology.com
. Practical Outcome for Polish Borrowers: The typical successful lawsuit in Poland ends with the loan contract being declared null from the start (ab initio). This means the borrower and bank must settle mutual restitution: the borrower returns the original loan amount (principal) in złoty, while the bank returns all amounts the borrower paid (installments, interest, fees). In many cases, especially for loans taken ~15 years ago, the borrower has already paid back an equivalent of the principal or more, so the bank ends up owing money to the borrower. For example, a borrower who took 300,000 zł in 2007 might have paid 250,000 zł in installments by 2022; if the loan is void, they owe the bank 300,000 zł (principal) but the bank owes them 250,000 zł – so net, the borrower pays only 50,000 zł and is free of the loan and mortgage on their home. If the borrower had paid more than principal over years, the bank must refund the excess. Thanks to the CJEU’s mid-2023 ruling, banks cannot claim any extra “fee” or interest for the capital usage
reuters.com
 – they only get the principal back, with no adjustment for inflation or time value. Meanwhile, borrowers are considering claiming additional compensation (like the opportunity cost of having their money tied up), since the CJEU said EU law doesn’t preclude such claims

Polish law firms report that some claims for damages or indexation against banks are indeed being filed, but Polish courts will have to decide those in line with general unjust enrichment principles and the guidance that consumers shouldn’t be over-compensated either (the SAFE blog notes consumers have “equality not superiority”, meaning the goal is to restore balance, not to confer a windfall)

. The effect of these cases has been huge for Polish banks. The Polish Bank Association and regulators initially sounded the alarm about costs potentially reaching 100 billion PLN (approximately €22 billion)
reuters.com
reuters.com
. Banks have dramatically increased their provisions for legal risks and many started offering voluntary settlements to borrowers out of court – typically converting the CHF loan to a złoty loan as if from the beginning, with perhaps some interest concession. Tens of thousands of such settlements have been made (by mid-2023 about 60,000 settlements)
reuters.com
reuters.com
. However, a large portion of borrowers have preferred to sue, as the court outcomes tend to be more favorable (no interest at all versus paying some interest in a settlement)
reuters.com
. After the CJEU ruled definitively that banks can’t pursue the “use of capital” claims, even more hesitant borrowers were emboldened – as one lawyer put it, “Borrowers who were afraid to sue the bank due to the threat of a bank lawsuit for remuneration for the use of capital after today’s judgment should no longer have such fears.”
reuters.com
. Consumer organizations like “Life Without Credit” (Życie Bez Kredytu) have been supporting borrowers through the process, and its founder described the 2023 CJEU decision as making him “ecstatic”

. In essence, Poland’s courts have become the mechanism to undo the foreign loan saga contract by contract. By mid-2025, Polish banks remain well-capitalized enough to absorb losses (as noted by ratings agencies and the KNF)
reuters.com
, though it certainly has curtailed new lending growth. There is ongoing debate in Poland about whether to introduce legislation to speed up case processing or to impose a unified settlement framework (as some other countries did), but given the advanced stage of the litigation wave, the focus is on managing the case load. Judges, guided by EU and Supreme Court precedents, continue to largely rule in borrowers’ favor, reinforcing that banks cannot both violate consumer rights and keep the benefits of such contracts. As the CJEU bluntly stated, the protection of consumers under EU law outweighs concerns about banking sector stability
reuters.com
 – a clear signal that justice for individuals is the priority, even if the collective outcome is expensive for lenders.
Other EU Countries: Croatia, Romania, and Beyond
Besides Hungary and Poland, several other EU member states experienced similar foreign-currency lending issues – albeit each with its own approach:
Croatia: In the late 2000s, a substantial number of Croatians took CHF-indexed loans. Croatia’s response was one of the most dramatic. After years of borrower protests (and some interim measures capping exchange rates), in 2015 the Croatian Parliament passed a law converting all Swiss franc-denominated loans into local currency (kuna) at a favorable fixed rate, applied retroactively. Banks were required to refund borrowers for past overpayments resulting from currency swings and interest rate changes. This effectively absolved consumers of the exchange rate losses but shifted the cost to banks – an estimated HRK 8 billion (≈€1.1 billion) hit to the banking sector
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. Foreign banks (mainly Austrian and Italian) challenged this law fiercely. The European Central Bank opined that the retroactive conversion “goes beyond what is necessary and proportionate to protect consumers” and violates Article 23(5) MCD’s ban on retroactive FX loan measures
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
. Banks also launched international arbitration against Croatia, claiming expropriation. Nevertheless, the law stood, and borrowers were effectively rescued from rising CHF debt. Legally, many of the individual Croatian cases became moot after conversion; however, some borrowers still sued over euro-denominated loans or other aspects, and Croatian courts have also applied CJEU case law (one recent CJEU case, Milivojević, involved Croatian FX loans). The Croatian example highlights a strong consumer-centric (if legally contentious) solution: the state itself voided the harmful contract terms en masse.
Romania: Romanian banks also sold many CHF loans (as well as loans in euro). After the crisis, Romanian courts saw numerous challenges. The Andriciuc case discussed earlier was a group of Romanian borrowers – and after the CJEU’s 2017 judgment, Romanian courts gained clarity that they must assess if the currency clause was explained sufficiently; if not, it could be declared unfair. Some Romanian judges did annul FX loan contracts or ordered conversions at the exchange rate at loan signing (effectively shifting the loss to banks). The Romanian Parliament passed a conversion law in 2016 that would have allowed all CHF loans to be converted to local currency at historical rates, but the Romanian Constitutional Court struck it down as unconstitutional (ruling it violated principles of non-retroactivity and financial stability, unless case-by-case hardship was shown). Another law in 2016, nicknamed “datio in solutum,” gave any consumer debtor the right to surrender the property to the bank to clear a mortgage debt; this law too was curtailed by the courts (they required proving that the currency shift was an “unforeseen circumstance” significantly affecting the ability to pay). So in Romania, relief has been mostly through individual lawsuits. There, too, the CJEU stepped in: e.g., Șerbănescu (C-81/19, 2020) clarified aspects of the “datio in solutum” law under the Unfair Terms Directive. Romanian consumer protection agencies actively assisted borrowers, and the National Bank of Romania issued public warnings about FX loan risks even before the crisis
europarl.europa.eu
. By the late 2010s, the stock of CHF loans in Romania fell (some were voluntarily converted or paid off), and the issue, while still present, is less large-scale than in Poland or Hungary. But the legal principles remain similar – lack of adequate risk disclosure can render a contract term unfair, per EU law.
Eurozone Countries (Spain, France, etc.): Foreign-currency mortgages were not just an Eastern European phenomenon. Spain, for example, had tens of thousands of “multidivisa” loans (often loans that could be toggled between yen, CHF, etc.). These were sold to consumers who sometimes didn’t grasp the risks. Spanish courts initially were divided, but by 2017–2018, Spain’s Supreme Court ruled that banks must ensure the client “has sufficient information to comprehend the currency risk”, echoing CJEU doctrine. If not, the FX clause could be voided as abusive. Many Spanish borrowers succeeded in converting their loans to euros by court order (with banks having to refund excess payments). France also saw similar cases (e.g., the Helvet Immo scandal, where BNP Paribas sold CHF loans to French borrowers who later sued). The French regulator in 2012 warned banks not to market FX loans to those without foreign-currency income
europarl.europa.eu
. While these Western EU cases were serious for the individuals involved, they did not pose systemic stability risks due to smaller scale
europarl.europa.eu
. Nevertheless, the legal reasoning – grounded in the Unfair Terms Directive – was essentially the same: transparency and fairness are required.
Other CEE countries: Several other Central/Eastern EU states had notable run-ups in FX lending. Bulgaria and Serbia had many euro and CHF loans (Serbia, not in the EU at the time, eventually had a negotiated conversion plan in 2019 for CHF loans). Ukraine and other non-EU Eastern countries likewise faced this (Ukraine’s parliament passed a conversion law in 2015). Slovenia and Montenegro also litigated CHF loan cases. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s courts voided many CHF loans for unfairness. In Austria – interestingly a eurozone country – banks had offered loans in CHF to domestic customers (often with interest-only terms), leading to significant losses for borrowers; Austrian courts too applied strict consumer-protection tests and many such loans were converted to euros by settlements.
In all these jurisdictions, the thread is the same: banks are expected to bear the consequences of inadequate risk disclosure. Courts across Europe, guided by the ECJ, have increasingly converged on a harmonized approach, as a European Parliament study observed: “The case law of the CJEU is having a determinant effect on redressing the harm caused by mis-selling of mortgage loans, in particular through the inclusion of ... foreign currency clauses. Groups of affected consumers are disseminating its judgments, contributing to an increasingly harmonised development of financial consumer law.”
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
 This growing body of precedent strengthens consumer confidence that they will be treated fairly and provides greater legal certainty for both borrowers and lenders in future
europarl.europa.eu
.
Consumer Advocacy and Ongoing Developments
The foreign-currency mortgage crisis has given rise to robust consumer advocacy movements throughout Europe. Affected borrowers, often called “FX loan victims,” have organized associations, pursued collective legal actions, and lobbied governments for relief. Their efforts have been instrumental in keeping the issue in the public eye and pushing legal boundaries. In Hungary, as detailed, a new nationwide association (Banki Károsultak Fogyasztóvédelmi Szövetsége) is rallying borrowers to join forces
alfahir.hu
. Its goal is to ensure that the recent legal breakthroughs actually translate into real compensation. Hungarian advocates are urging the government to facilitate legal proceedings (for example, covering court fees) and ultimately to make banks foot the bill for the “wrong” that was done
alfahir.hu
alfahir.hu
. There is a sense of empowerment now that EU law is clearly on the consumers’ side. The message from advocates is “devizások (FX borrowers), do not give up hope – group together, organize, and submit your claims”, because if they present a united front, “they cannot be swept aside.”
alfahir.hu
alfahir.hu
 This push may result in further legislative action or mass settlements in Hungary in the near future. In Poland, consumer foundations like the Association of Stop Bank Swaps (Stop Bankowym Klauzulom Abuzywnym) and the aforementioned Life Without Credit have been very active. They disseminate information about court decisions, connect borrowers with specialized lawyers, and even pursue strategic litigation. Polish borrowers often attend court in large numbers and share their stories in the media. This grassroots pressure arguably influenced the KNF (regulator) to urge banks toward voluntary settlements to stem the tide. The battle is not over – as of 2025, there are discussions about whether banks might attempt some form of “grand settlement” or whether the government might impose a bank tax to fund remaining claims. But importantly, borrowers now have the legal upper hand, so any settlements must be attractive enough (e.g., banks waiving a large portion of remaining loan balances) to convince borrowers not to simply sue and likely win outright. On the EU level, the topic of foreign-currency loans has also informed regulatory thinking. The Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD) in 2014 was a direct response to this saga: it mandates risk warnings and conversion rights for new FX loans, which should prevent a repeat of the 2005–2008 bubble. The MCD also required lenders to assess consumers’ ability to withstand currency moves (and interest rate increases) – effectively raising underwriting standards. The European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Central Bank (ECB) have issued guidelines and opinions on FX lending (the ECB published multiple opinions on Hungary’s and Poland’s measures between 2010–2015
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
). The consensus was that FX lending to consumers who don’t earn in that currency is imprudent and should be tightly controlled. As a result, by 2020, the share of new mortgages in foreign currency in Central/Eastern Europe had fallen to very low levels (except where loans are in euro but the country pegs to euro, like Bulgaria). This is a positive outcome of painful lessons learned. From a legal scholarship perspective, much has been written about balancing consumer protection with financial stability. Some scholars (like Nikolai Badenhoop in the SAFE Finance Blog) have argued that while the ECJ’s stance “strengthens the claims of consumer borrowers”, it “neglects the systemic risks for the issuing banks.”
safe-frankfurt.de
 They caution that large-scale restitution (paybacks) could even contribute to a banking crisis in worst-case scenarios
safe-frankfurt.de
safe-frankfurt.de
. For example, if most Polish borrowers get all their money back, some mid-sized banks could face insolvency
safe-frankfurt.de
safe-frankfurt.de
. However, the ECJ explicitly brushed aside systemic risk arguments: in its view, banks should not be allowed to benefit from unfair terms regardless of the impact, and it is up to other mechanisms (regulators, central banks, governments) to ensure financial stability
safe-frankfurt.de
. The principle of “no penalization” of consumers for exercising their rights is central – instead, it is the banks that are penalized for using abusive clauses
safe-frankfurt.de
safe-frankfurt.de
. This has a dissuasive effect against future mis-selling. Indeed, banks across the EU have become far more cautious in selling complex products to retail customers since this saga. Looking forward, the interplay of national solutions vs. EU-wide principles will continue. Some countries chose bold legislative fixes (e.g., Croatia’s law, Hungary’s forced conversion), but those sometimes clashed with EU law (e.g., retroactivity issues). Other countries relied on courts and the EU directive framework (Poland, Romania, Spain), which has taken longer but eventually delivered consumer justice on a case-by-case basis. The ideal approach, as some experts suggest, might be for regulators and banks to pre-emptively convert or compensate in cooperation with consumer groups, thus avoiding lengthy litigation. However, such negotiated settlements have been rare, in part because banks feared setting costly precedents or admitting wrongdoing. One trend is clear: consumer awareness is now much higher. Borrowers are unlikely to be easily lured by foreign currency loans in the future without substantial guarantees. In Hungary, Poland, and elsewhere, people often refer to themselves as “devizahitelesek” (FX borrowers) and have become a political constituency of sorts. Their experience has led to calls for stronger financial consumer protection frameworks. EU institutions periodically review consumer credit laws – for instance, the ECJ’s stance in the Schyns case (2022) even suggested that some MCD provisions could apply retroactively outside their scope, hinting at a willingness to use all tools to protect consumers
safe-frankfurt.de
safe-frankfurt.de
. In sum, the legacy of the foreign currency mortgage debacle is a Europe that is more vigilant about fair lending. Consumers who feel they were misled or treated unfairly have a robust set of precedents to back up their claims. They can cite national Supreme Court decisions and CJEU judgments that clearly condemn the failure to warn about currency risk. Whether through courts or through collective pressure on policymakers, borrowers are seeking (and often obtaining) refunds, contract annulments, or conversions that restore a fair balance.
Conclusion
The saga of foreign-currency mortgages in the EU – especially in countries like Hungary and Poland – underscores the importance of transparency and fairness in financial contracts. Between 2005 and 2010, hundreds of thousands of European consumers entered loan agreements that they did not fully understand, largely because banks did not adequately inform them of the enormous currency risk involved. When that risk materialized, the consequences were devastating: families saw their debt burdens explode through no fault of their own. Over the past decade, consumer protection laws and courts have risen to meet this challenge. European and national legal precedents now firmly establish that if a bank failed to explain a loan’s currency risk in clear, understandable terms, the contract can be deemed unfair and void. The Court of Justice of the EU has been unequivocal: banks cannot hide behind fine print and then enforce onerous terms on consumers. Instead, such contracts must be unwound – with borrowers reimbursed for what they’ve paid – to restore them to the position they would have been in had they known the truth

. Stability concerns or industry costs do not override consumer rights

. This is a powerful affirmation of the EU’s commitment to its citizens in the marketplace. For a borrower preparing to file a complaint or refund claim today (for example, a Hungarian borrower who had a CHF mortgage in 2008–2010), the accumulated precedents form a compelling arsenal:
Regulatory findings show banks routinely failed to warn consumers (e.g. Poland’s UOKiK and Hungary’s Central Bank reports)
europarl.europa.eu
europarl.europa.eu
.
EU case law (from Andriciuc to Dziubak to the 2025 Hungarian case) recognizes that one-sided currency risk clauses are unfair and unenforceable when not clearly explained

.
National case law (Hungarian Curia’s 2025 uniformity decision, Polish Supreme Court resolutions, etc.) backs up the voiding of such contracts and refunds of payments
kuria-birosag.hu
lexology.com
.
Legislative actions (like Hungary’s 2014 acts or Croatia’s 2015 law) demonstrate that governments acknowledged the injustice and took corrective measures, which bolsters the argument that these loans were fundamentally problematic.
Academic and expert analysis frames these loans as mis-sold products that shifted excessive risk to consumers, violating principles of good faith and equity
safe-frankfurt.de
safe-frankfurt.de
.
Consumer stories and advocacy provide moral weight, showing the real harm caused and the public interest in holding banks accountable. In Hungary, for instance, politicians are openly calling the FX loans a “faulty product” for which “the banks must pay”
alfahir.hu
.
All of this can be cited in a well-founded complaint. A borrower can argue that the bank breached its duty of informed consent, and thus the currency clause (if not the entire loan contract) should be nullified as an unfair term under Directive 93/13/EEC. They can further point out that per CJEU and national rulings, the remedy for an invalid contract is restitution – meaning the bank should return all interest and fees paid, and accept just the principal back
ceelegalmatters.com
ceelegalmatters.com
 (or if the borrower has overpaid the principal, the bank should refund the difference). They can reference the latest Hungarian case where exactly this outcome was reached
ceelegalmatters.com
, or the Polish practice where thousands of judgments have freed consumers from CHF loans on similar grounds
reuters.com
reuters.com
. It’s worth noting that each individual case may require showing evidence of the lack of proper warning – e.g. what did the loan contract and informational documents say, what did bank officers orally communicate, etc. But the general presumption supported by precedent is that simply including a generic phrase about possible currency movements was not enough to meet the bank’s obligation
eur-lex.europa.eu
. The information must have been sufficient for a layperson to truly appreciate the risk – something most banks failed to deliver. Finally, the foreign-currency mortgage episode has taught EU banks and regulators a lasting lesson. Never again should a complex financial risk be offloaded onto consumers without robust safeguards. The combination of consumer vigilance, legal enforcement, and (if needed) political intervention, has shown that even years later, justice can be sought and obtained. Borrowers who once felt trapped by rising debt have, through perseverance and the rule of law, transformed into empowered consumers able to assert their rights. This serves as a cautionary tale to lenders: transparency and fairness are not just ethical obligations, but legal ones – enforceable with potent consequences. In conclusion, any consumer in an EU country who was harmed by a foreign-currency mortgage in 2005–2010 can draw on “every precedent in the EU” discussed above. The weight of evidence and authority is on their side to demand an annulment of unfair loan terms and a refund of excess payments. The momentum of recent decisions – especially for Hungarian borrowers – suggests that their chances of success have never been higher. What began as individual hardships has culminated in a collective affirmation of consumer rights across Europe, ensuring greater fairness in financial markets going forward. Sources:
