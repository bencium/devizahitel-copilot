# Central and Eastern European Foreign Currency Mortgage Scandal: Bank Involvement and Individual Accountability

## Key Finding: Limited Direct Evidence for Target Banks

Based on extensive searches through SEC filings, **there is minimal direct evidence of Barclays, NatWest/RBS, or JPMorgan having significant retail banking operations or direct foreign currency mortgage exposure** in Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Czech Republic, Romania, and Slovenia during the 2005-2010 period.

***

## 1. Geographical Presence Analysis

### A. **Banks With Documented Direct Presence**

**Deutsche Bank** :[^1]

- **Active operations** in Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia
- Credit exposures requiring countercyclical capital buffer calculations
- Indicates substantial lending activities in these markets

**ING Group** :[^2]

- **Direct branch operations** across the region:
    - **Romania**: ING Bank N.V. Branch (Wholesale/Retail)
    - **Czech Republic**: ING Bank N.V. Branch (Wholesale)
    - **Hungary**: ING Bank N.V. Branch (Wholesale)
    - **Slovakia**: ING Bank N.V. Branch (Wholesale)
    - **Bulgaria**: ING Bank N.V. Branch (Wholesale)

**Banco Santander** :[^3]

- **Major retail presence in Poland**:
    - Santander Bank Polska S.A.
    - Santander Consumer Bank S.A.
    - CHF mortgage portfolio: **PLN 4,686 million (EUR 1,118.5 million)** as of March 2025
    - Total litigation provisions: **PLN 6,124 million (EUR 1,461.8 million)**


### B. **Target Banks: Limited Documented Presence**

**Barclays, NatWest/RBS, JPMorgan**:

- **No SEC filings found** documenting significant retail banking subsidiaries or branches in the target CEE countries
- **No direct evidence** of substantial foreign currency mortgage portfolios in these markets
- **No named individuals** in investigations or prosecutions related to CEE mortgage mis-selling

***

## 2. Foreign Currency Mortgage Scandal Evidence

### A. **Polish CHF Mortgage Crisis**[^3]

**Scale of the Problem**:

- Santander alone has **EUR 1.1+ billion in outstanding CHF mortgages** in Poland
- **EUR 1.4+ billion in legal provisions** as of March 2025
- Ongoing litigation with thousands of individual borrowers

**Legal and Regulatory Framework**:

- **Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF)** oversight
- **Court of Justice of European Union (CJEU)** rulings on unfair contract terms
- **Polish Supreme Court** decisions on foreign currency exchange rate clauses
- **European Commission Directive 93/13/EEC** on unfair terms in consumer contracts

**Key Court Decisions** :[^3]

- **October 2019**: CJEU ruled on potentially unfair CHF loan contract clauses
- **June 2023**: CJEU Case C-520/21 confirmed national law relevance for contract cancellation
- **April 2024**: Polish Supreme Court ruled on exchange rate determination methods

***

## 3. Individual Accountability: Notable Absence

### **No Named Individuals Found**

Despite extensive searches, **no SEC filings contained specific names of individuals** from Barclays, NatWest/RBS, or JPMorgan who were:

- **Investigated** for foreign currency mortgage misconduct in CEE countries
- **Prosecuted** by regulatory authorities in Hungary, Poland, Croatia, etc.
- **Named as defendants** in individual capacity in mortgage mis-selling litigation
- **Identified as directors/executives** of CEE branches responsible for mortgage products


### **What This Suggests**

1. **Indirect Role**: These banks likely played **wholesale or intermediary roles** rather than direct consumer-facing mortgage origination
2. **Limited Retail Presence**: **No significant retail banking networks** in these markets during the critical period
3. **Regulatory Focus**: **Regulatory actions focused on banks with direct customer relationships** in the affected markets

***

## 4. Branch and Subsidiary Analysis

### A. **Documented Corporate Structures**

From subsidiary listings in various SEC filings [170-185], major international companies have extensive networks in CEE countries, including:

**Countries with Heavy International Corporate Presence**:

- **Czech Republic**: Multiple subsidiaries across technology, pharmaceuticals, industrial companies
- **Hungary**: Significant subsidiary presence (Medtronic, TD SYNNEX, Infosys, SAP, etc.)
- **Poland**: Extensive operations (Infosys, TD SYNNEX, Dun \& Bradstreet, etc.)
- **Croatia**: Some subsidiary presence (Medtronic, TD SYNNEX, SAP, etc.)
- **Romania**: Various international subsidiaries
- **Slovenia**: Limited but present subsidiary operations


### B. **Banking Sector Contrast**

**Notable Absence**: Despite extensive corporate subsidiary networks in these countries, **Barclays, NatWest/RBS, and JPMorgan do not appear in subsidiary listings** for significant retail banking operations in the target CEE countries.

***

## 5. Regulatory and Legal Context

### A. **Primary Liability Pattern**

The evidence suggests **direct liability falls primarily on banks with retail customer relationships**:

1. **Local/Regional Banks**: With direct consumer lending operations
2. **European Banks with CEE Presence**: Like Santander, ING, Deutsche Bank
3. **Wholesale/Intermediary Banks**: Limited direct consumer litigation exposure

### B. **Regulatory Approach**

**European Commission and National Regulators** appear to focus enforcement on:

- **Direct lenders** to consumers
- **Banks with local retail networks**
- **Institutions that originated mortgage products** rather than wholesale funders

***

## 6. Summary and Implications

### **Key Conclusions**

1. **Limited Direct Exposure**: Barclays, NatWest/RBS, and JPMorgan appear to have had **limited direct retail mortgage exposure** in CEE markets
2. **No Individual Prosecutions Found**: **No SEC filings identify specific individuals** from these banks facing prosecution or investigation for CEE mortgage misconduct
3. **Indirect Market Participation**: These banks likely participated as:
    - **Wholesale funding providers**
    - **Derivative/hedging counterparties**
    - **Intermediaries in securitization chains**
    - **Not direct consumer mortgage originators**
4. **Regulatory Focus Elsewhere**: **Major regulatory actions and individual accountability** have centered on banks with direct consumer relationships in affected markets

### **Data Limitations**

This analysis is based on **US SEC filings only**. Additional information about individual accountability might exist in:

- **European regulatory filings**
- **UK FCA enforcement actions**
- **National regulatory databases** in CEE countries
- **Court records** in affected jurisdictions
- **Parliamentary or congressional testimony**

The **absence of evidence in SEC filings does not definitively prove absence of involvement**, but suggests any role was likely **indirect or wholesale-focused rather than retail consumer-facing**.
