# Foreign Currency Mortgage and Loan Scandal Involving JPMorgan, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), and NatWest (2005–2010): USA, UK, and EU

## Main Takeaway

There is **extensive evidence of regulatory and legal action surrounding foreign currency market manipulation and misconduct in mortgage and loan products among major banks including JPMorgan, Barclays, RBS, and NatWest for activities primarily spanning the mid-2000s to early 2010s**. However, there is **little direct evidence in US or UK filings of a specific “scandal” involving the mis-selling of foreign currency mortgages in the USA/UK/EU** by these banks in the way seen in e.g., Polish CHF mortgages. The companies were, however, central players in FX, interest rate benchmark, and derivatives scandals that tangentially affected currency-based lending and mortgage products, with NatWest/RBS sometimes playing a wholesaler or intermediary role.

***

## 1. Overview of What Occurred (2005–2010)

- The **mid-2000s to early 2010s** saw a global boom in complex mortgage and loan products, including **foreign currency denominated loans** (e.g., Swiss franc, yen, euro) sold to customers in the UK, Ireland, Eastern Europe, and elsewhere.
- Many of these products exposed borrowers to extreme currency risks. When the global financial crisis hit and exchange rates moved sharply, **many borrowers suffered catastrophic losses** as repayments spiked.
- In parallel, major banks were **found to have manipulated FX rates and interest rate benchmarks (such as LIBOR and EURIBOR)**—the same benchmarks underpinning many currency-linked loans and mortgages.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

***

## 2. Bank Involvement and Regulatory Action

### A. **Barclays**

- Barclays was **directly implicated in FX and interest rate benchmark manipulation scandals** (LIBOR, EURIBOR), with settlements and fines in the US, UK, and EU. This manipulation affected products—mortgages, loans, and derivatives—pegged to those rates.[^3][^4][^5]
- **Multiple class actions** alleged manipulation of FX rates and benchmarks, including settlements in the US and regulatory action in the EU.[^4][^5][^3]
- **Civil lawsuits and regulatory actions** encompassed the alleged mis-selling and mis-marketing of complex mortgage products (including those tied to foreign currencies), but most legal exposure was for rate-rigging and FX manipulation, not direct mortgage mis-selling in the UK/US.[^3][^4]


### B. **Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS)/NatWest**

- RBS/NatWest (NatWest Group) was also **a central defendant in benchmark rate and FX scandal litigation**. NatWest and RBS were involved as wholesale market participants—sometimes intermediaries for foreign currency mortgage products.[^7][^8][^9][^6][^10]
- Like Barclays, they faced **class actions and regulatory proceedings for FX and LIBOR/EURIBOR manipulation** across the US, UK, and EU.[^8][^6][^7]
- **No direct evidence** in filings of US/UK mass litigation over foreign currency mortgage mis-selling by RBS/NatWest, but documentation shows they were targeted for broader currency, rate, and cross-border misconduct.


### C. **JPMorgan Chase**

- JPMorgan was **an active participant in FX and LIBOR/EURIBOR rigging scandals**, with regulatory and private litigation spanning the globe. These actions covered US, UK, and EU practices related to derivatives, swaps, and products referencing these rates.[^2][^1]
- The bank only occasionally issued or wholesaled currency-linked mortgage products in the UK/EU and did not feature in consumer mortgage mis-selling scandals to the degree seen in other banks abroad.[^11][^1][^2]

## 3. Geographical Context and Product Types

| Bank | USA | UK/Ireland | EU (notably CEE/Poland) |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Barclays | FX/LIBOR/EURIBOR cases; investor derivatives lawsuits | FX/LIBOR/EURIBOR, benchmark rate manipulation, mortgage litigation (but no mass mis-selling cases like CEE) | Limited direct liability for CEE CHF mortgage mis-selling; some involvement as intermediary/wholesaler |
| RBS/NatWest | FX/LIBOR/EURIBOR litigation; some loan product class actions | Same as Barclays (see above); known as "wholesaler" for brokers/banks bundling foreign-currency-linked UK/EU loans | Some lawsuits as intermediary and originator in CEE markets, but mostly sued for cartel/FX action |
| JPMorgan | FX/LIBOR/EURIBOR manipulation; class actions for rate-based products | LIBOR/EURIBOR regulatory scrutiny/test cases | Participated in wholesale market, but no evidence of large-scale currency mortgage mis-selling exposure in filings |


***

## 4. Key Legal Cases, Settlements, and Regulatory Actions (Selected)

- **FX Manipulation and LIBOR/EURIBOR Cartel Cases:**
    - All three banks faced actions in the US (SDNY class actions), UK (Competition Appeal Tribunal), EU (European Commission), plus in Israel, Brazil, Australia, and other jurisdictions.[^5][^9][^6][^1][^2][^7][^4][^8][^3]
    - Barclays: Settlements totaling at least \$384 million in the US FX action, additional settlements and fines in various jurisdictions.[^4][^5][^3]
    - NatWest/RBS: Settled significant class actions in multiple jurisdictions; litigation ongoing in some cases.[^9][^6][^7]
    - JPMorgan: Named as defendant, resolved some actions, others ongoing.[^1][^2][^11]
- **Mortgage and Loan Product Litigation:**
    - In **continental Europe** (especially Poland, Hungary), there is extensive litigation and settlements related to **foreign currency mortgage mis-selling**—but Barclays, RBS, NatWest, and JPMorgan are not the primary faces of these lawsuits, except sometimes as originators or intermediaries.
    - In the UK, **tracker mortgage and interest rate swap mis-selling** (rather than foreign currency mortgage mis-selling) saw significant regulatory and remediation activity, often overseen by the FCA.[^6]
    - In Ireland, the **CBI’s tracker mortgage investigation** (2001–2015) affected RBS/NatWest’s Ulster Bank unit.[^6]
- **Wholesaler Role:**
    - NatWest/RBS sometimes acted as a wholesaler or intermediary, bundling foreign currency mortgage products for mortgage brokers or other lenders in the UK/EU. However, this role is not the central focus of major regulatory findings in US/UK filings during the period researched.

***

## 5. Cross-Border Impact and Wider European Controversy

- The **major epicenter for foreign currency mortgage product lawsuits is Central/Eastern Europe**—especially Poland, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, and Slovenia—where CHF (Swiss franc) loans were mass-marketed and often facilitated by large international banks as either direct lenders or wholesale funders/intermediaries.
- In many court actions and regulatory investigations (see Deutsche Bank, Santander, etc.), **UK and US banks are sometimes named as ‘source banks’ providing funding, hedging, or intermediation support for the smaller local lenders**, but the bulk of legal responsibility often falls on local banks and originators.[^12][^13][^14][^15][^16][^17][^18]
- In the UK and Ireland, the **scandals most closely related to this dynamic involve interest rate swap mis-selling, tracker mortgage mis-selling, and (to a lesser degree) FX swap-linked lending**, rather than direct FX mortgage product mis-selling at a consumer level.

## 6. Summary Table of Principal Legal Exposures (2005–2010 and Later)

| Bank | FX/Benchmark Rate Manipulation | FX/Product Mis-Selling | Mortgage Litigation/Settlements | Intermediary/Wholesale Role |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Barclays | Yes (LIBOR/EURIBOR/FX cartel) | Yes (FX, to degree) | No major UK/EU/US consumer mass claims | Sometimes |
| RBS/NatWest | Yes (LIBOR/EURIBOR/FX cartel) | Yes (FX cartel) | Tracker/IR swap in UK/Ireland; minor FX mortgage | Sometimes |
| JPMorgan | Yes (LIBOR/EURIBOR/FX cartel) | Yes (minor FX only) | Minimal direct UK/EU/US consumer mis-selling | Limited |


***

## 7. Research Notes and Current Legal Proceedings

- **Major regulatory investigations have largely been resolved**, with settlements agreed in multiple jurisdictions (see 2018–2024 SEC filings).
- Ongoing civil litigation in the US, UK, Israel, Australia, the Netherlands primarily targets **FX manipulation and benchmark rigging**.
- **No large-scale class-action settlement or regulatory censure in the UK/US filings directly references mass mis-selling of currency-linked mortgages to retail consumers** by Barclays, RBS/NatWest, or JPMorgan in the UK/US. However, foreign currency mortgage mis-selling to consumers remains a high-profile legal/consumer issue for continental European banks, notably in Poland and Hungary.[^13][^14][^15][^16]

***

## Conclusion

- **Summary:** While Barclays, RBS/NatWest, and JPMorgan Chase were central to the major scandals around FX manipulation, rate-rigging, and cross-border mortgage product complexity (sometimes acting as wholesalers or intermediaries for mortgage products), **direct US/UK/EU mass-litigation or regulatory actions over foreign currency mortgage mis-selling** (of the scale seen in continental Europe) have not been surfaced in their public SEC filings or known settlements.
- **Regulatory and legal focus in the UK and US has instead primarily centered on the manipulation of FX and interest rate benchmarks** (LIBOR, EURIBOR), which affected a wide range of financial products, including mortgages and loans.

For reference, additional litigation and controversy over Polish, Spanish, and other continental European foreign currency mortgages continues to unfold—mostly involving the respective local banks as principal defendants. Barclays, RBS/NatWest, and JPMorgan appear sometimes as intermediaries or wholesalers but not as primary defendants in those class actions.[^14][^15][^16][^13][^6]
