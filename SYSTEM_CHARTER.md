# Hungarian FX Mortgage Legal Research System - System Charter

**Single Source of Truth for Technical Stack, Privacy Modes, Database Choice, and Supported Jurisdictions**

---

## üéØ **System Mission**

The Hungarian Foreign-Currency Mortgage Legal Research Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to help lawyers efficiently analyze legal documents, extract contract clauses, match precedents, and calculate financial damages for 2006-2016 foreign-currency mortgages where banks failed to warn on exchange-rate risk.

**Core Business Domain**: Consumer protection and contract law (EU Directive 93/13/EEC unfair terms) focusing on CHF/EUR denominated mortgages with inadequate FX risk disclosure.
